# GetToKnowMeAgain

## Description 

I made this website in order to make a placeholder where I can advertise my work, provide some information about my background and offer ways for those who want to contact me. I wanted a simple and stylish page with all the necessary information.


## Usage 

The page has a navigation pane in the header with three tabs that leed to the main informative sections in the main part of the page. 


## Credits

This page wouldn't exist without the help of the TA's and the collaboration of the bootcamp students.
